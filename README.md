# AI_ML_Playground
AI ML Playground is a curated collection of everything I've learned in my 2-year journey into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. From foundational concepts to hands-on projects, this repo reflects the ups and downs, the breakthroughs, and the grind of building real understanding. It’s not just code—it’s the result of countless late nights, debugging marathons, and relentless curiosity. 

# What's Inside
Machine Learning models & experiments
Deep Learning architectures
NLP, Computer Vision, and more
Notes, notebooks, and useful resources
Projects, mini-apps, and personal challenges

 # Personal Note
This journey wasn’t easy—but every challenge became a lesson, and every failure pushed me forward. I’m sharing this not as a final destination, but as a milestone. I hope it helps someone else on their path.
