What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

Instead of writing rules manually, you feed the machine data â€” and it finds patterns on its own.

ðŸ§  3 Main Types of Machine Learning:
Supervised Learning
â†’ You give the model input-output pairs, and it learns to map them.
âœ… Use case: Predicting house prices, spam detection.

Unsupervised Learning
â†’ The model gets only input data, and it finds hidden patterns or groupings.
âœ… Use case: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection.

Reinforcement Learning
â†’ An agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment, getting rewards or penalties.
âœ… Use case: Game-playing AIs, robotics.
